CPG 9,INTELLIGENT VIDEO DESCRIPTION," As per our prior discussion on 23.1.20 when our project was accepted by you and cross checking on google patents:

Aim:
This particular invention aims to extract rich information from a video file frame by frame.
This information is then used for any of the 3 purposes:

1.	Fed to a pre-existent TTS (text to speech) system in order to aid visually impaired users.
2.	Create a document to give a scene by scene detailed analysis of the video.
3.	Using frequency of occurrence of certain words give tags for the video.


Methodology: -
By setting a suitable frame rate as per requirement and video length, images are extracted.
These images are fed to a Recurrent Neural Network in order to identify the “players” and “components” from the frame.
Then via natural language processing, word vectors and markov chains the relationship between these “players” and “components”
Is observed to give an accurate description of the scene.

When pieced together the captions/descriptions of these frames creates a step by step summary of the entire video thereby providing information about the activities and scenes.


Outputs: -

2.Create a document to give a scene by scene detailed analysis of the video.
3.Using frequency of occurrence of certain words give tags for    the video.


Future Scope: -
Descriptions of scenes with high similarity may be detected and discarded automatically.

The complexity of the project is high, still for further refinement strategies pertinent to selection of most relevant scenes may be explored as well as better filtering.

CPG 18,Driver Monitoring System,"In this Project we will attempt to make a Driver monitoring system. The project will have 5 parts namely - Heart Rate & Blood Pressure monitoring system, Respiratory Rate Measurement system, Alcohol detection system, Lane Change Detection system and Post Accident Response system. The former 4 systems will work at all times when  the vehicle is in motion while the latter will only be activated in case of an emergency. The five systems will work as follows:

Heart Rate & Blood Pressure monitoring system:This system will keep track of the Cardiovascular profile of the driver to make sure that he/she is in a good state to drive. The blood pressure will be measured using the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals which can measure Cardiovascular pulses by measuring the differences in reflected and transmitted light. The Heart Rate of the driver will be detected by facial skin color variation caused by blood circulation.

Respiratory Rate measurement system: This system will measure the respiratory rate of the driver by using eulerian video magnification to sense the subtle movements in the chest region. These movements will be measured by magnifying the region of interest manifold.
   
Alcohol detection system: This system will check the driver’s breath for alcohol. A MQ3-Alcohol Gas Sensor will be used to detect alcohol fumes in the driver’s breath. If the alcohol content if greater than a threshold limit steps will be taken to ensure the driver’s safety.

Lane Change Detection system: This system will check the road lane markings to make sure the driver does not break the lane changing rules. For example, if the driver is on a white line marked road (which does not permit drivers to switch lanes) and he/she tries to  switch to another lane, a buzzer will alert the driver of his/her mistake.

Post Accident Response system: In case of an accident this system will alert the concerned authorities. The driver will be given an option to stop the system from sending for help in case of a false alarm.

CPG 27,AR Based Application for Students,"Capstone Project Proposal – AR Based Application for Student Guidance

Aim: To make a student-centred based utility application.

The implications for apps on phones which have location services enabled are brilliant for app creators. One of those is using augmented reality based on the location. What this means is that you can overlay digital data (let’s say, over a photo function in an app) so you have digitized animations, pictures or other data over real, physical space. When you combine this augmented reality technology with location-based sensors, existing geo-markers and GPS, you can see how powerful this can be. Wikitude Geo AR, Google Lens and PokemonGo are a few examples of location-based AR applications often used by students.   
The result of doing this well can be a uniquely engaging experience for the user, and the possible applications of this are only just starting to be explored.

Sensors to be used in mobile phones:

Accelerometer
Gyroscope
GPS

Features of the App:

Locating Teacher Cabins, Labs and Classrooms
Building Recognition with AR pop-ups of points of interest related to that building, for example, hostel menus or class schedules. 
Café/Shop recognition and virtual display of specialities related to the food menu of the place.
Locating nearby places of interest using GPS, visible on the phone screen as a virtual object in the real world.
Including a rating system that gives a rating to a particular place, based on a database of reviews.
Directions with arrows for navigation between classes and building within campus.
Cos restaurants and Hostel Menus AR pop-ups along with additional information such as phone numbers, etc.
A column to update the students about all the latest events happening in college.


What we are ensuring through our project:

Various sensors on the smartphone must be queried correctly at the same time so that the position and altitude of the phone are taken into account and processed.
Accurately display points of interest or the “virtual” aspects layered on the screen, no matter which angle of view the smartphone camera is pointing at.
Calculating the distance between two points efficiently based on GPS data.
Using image stitching to mark a location accurately, so that all angles and overlapping fields of view are taken into consideration.
Accurately locating teacher cabins, classrooms, labs, and places of interest in Patiala using location services such as GPS (external), navigating through augmented reality arrows leading the user to the desired location. 
Using multiple databases to store the reviews for a place, to store the markers of various restaurants, shops, classes, etc.",Dr. Seemu Sharma,Dr. Nidhi Kalra,101703368,Neha Varma,,,,,,,0,,0,,,,,0,,,,,0

This is helping assistance for blind students who cannot read books like a normal person. They have to use brail for book reading which is very problematic as well as time consuming for them. So for this reason we thought to make study easier for them like it is for us, so that they can also grow like a normal person and will not feel inferior to others . This is a tool which we provide them and when they wear this tool the camera attached on it will scan the book and the speaker attached will be going to read the text located on that book.

CPG 66,Epilepsy Detector,"Epilepsy is one of the common neurological disorders characterized by a sudden and recurrent malfunction of the brain that is termed “seizure”, affecting around 50 million individuals worldwide. As our intended study population is infantile spasms/West syndrome, I suggest that we focus on recognizing the true spasms more extensively and precisely. It consists of a characteristic muscular contraction that lasts 1 to 2 s, and reaches a peak more slowly than a myoclonic jerk, but more rapidly than a tonic seizure. This proposal would intend for extensive data collection in the subset of patients who are admitted for EEG monitoring and treatment for 24 hours. The comprehensive data collection would include physiologic parameters like EEG recordings pre-during-post ictal phases,external noise levels. A tentative period of 1-year may be devoted for data collection. This data would be analyzed using artificial intelligence techniques to recognize patterns for predicting onset of seizures a few minutes prior to their actual onset.

1. Rash driving in accident prone zones like hairpin bends in hilly areas, blind curves, etc.
2. Road hazards like potholes, uncovered manholes, etc .

We propose a multi pronged approach to solve these problems i.e  utilizing on-ground sensor technology along with multi-modal sensor application of smartphones to detect, analyze and warn drivers so that they reach their destination safely, economically and comfortably. We also aim to harness the power of data analytics and machine learning in our model.

Hairpin bends are especially accident prone areas. The vehicles at such bends tend to overtake and over-speed causing collisions because drivers don’t know what’s coming from the other side.
To alert drivers on both sides so that they can take appropriate actions (slowing down, braking) in time, sound alerts are most effective as human beings respond to sound alert most quickly. The two poles located by the side of roads sense vehicles approaching the turn from both sides and generate a loud sound alert.

Power of Smartphones and Participatory Sensing
==========================================
Surface analysis methods like Ground Penetrating Radar and sophisticated commercial products to detect road damage and hazards do exist but are too expensive. Since improved road traffic safety is wanted by government as well as drivers, we propose data collection in this regard would be most efficient and cost effective if done voluntarily by public (Participatory sensing approach). For this to be feasible, the mode of interaction should be easily available. Smartphones are an obvious practical choice allowing access to both a vast array of sensors as well as appeal to the common public. 

We propose a value added additional layer to existing popular map APIs instead of a completely new separate service to make it attractive to existing users. This service would be accessible via smartphones and will have road hazard information and also provide warnings related to blind curves and accident prone areas(based on traffic accident data).

CPG 75,Smart Roads ,"We aim to make roads smarter and safer. We have analyzed two main factors that make roads unsafe:
1. Rash driving in accident prone zones like hairpin bends in hilly areas, blind curves, etc.
2. Road hazards like potholes, uncovered manholes, etc .

We propose a multi pronged approach to solve these problems i.e  utilizing on-ground sensor technology along with multi-modal sensor application of smartphones to detect, analyze and warn drivers so that they reach their destination safely, economically and comfortably. We also aim to harness the power of data analytics and machine learning in our model.

CPG 80,Audio Prescription,"The idea being proposed is to develop an Audio based prescription application to enable the patient to access doctor’s advice. • The doctor’s voice would be recorded via microphone(in mobile devices/ PC or dedicated) and analysed using NLP for keywords.
 • The audio would be transcribed and saved separately, the analysed keywords are then recorded in tabular form by segregating them into different info heads i.e. “Patient's Details, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Prescription and Advice.”
• Usually a normal patient would not be expected to know medical terms, for that a provision for brief description of these terms would be made, which the user can access by hovering over the keyword itself, a hyperlink to know more about the term will also be provided. 
• After the processing of data, doctor will be asked for final confirmation. The data so far saved will then be linked to the patient's account, which he/she will be able to access by logging into his/her
account.
 • A QR code along with a link will also be generated (will be texted or whatsapp to the patient), which will enable the patient to view this information without logging in on the app.
 • The Patient will be able to access the following features :

CPG 130,Healthcare monitoring system," Monitoring your beloved ones becomes a difficult task in the modern day life. Keeping track of the health status of the your patient at home is a difficult task. Specially old age patients should be periodically monitored and their loved ones need to be informed about their health status from time to time while at work. So we propose an innovative system that automated this task with ease. Our system puts forward a smart patient health tracking system that uses Sensors to track patient health and uses internet to inform their loved ones in case of any issues. Our system uses temperature as well as heartbeat sensing to keep track of patient health. The sensors are connected to a microcontroller to track the status which is in turn interfaced to an lcd display as well as wifi connection in order to transmit alerts. If system detects any abrupt changes in patient heartbeat or body temperature, the system automatically alerts the user about the patients status over IOT and also shows details of heartbeat and temperature of patient live over the internet. Thus IOT based patient health tracking system effectively uses internet to monitor patient health stats and save lives on time.",Dr. Neenu Garg,,101703111,Aryan Pratap Asija,,,,,,,0,,0,,,,,0,,,,,0

CPG 162,Word identification in sentences through Event related brain potentials,"In this project, we intend to identify particular words in a sentence through Event-Related Potentials (ERP). We focus on identification of word processing in sentences using the N400 component of the ERP signal. We plan to create our own dataset by giving audio signals to subjects whilst recording their EEG signals. The age group of our subjects is going to be between 8-12 yrs.
